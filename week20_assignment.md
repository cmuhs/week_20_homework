* EDA
	- Examine the following three notebooks exploring the Kaggle Titanic dataset
		-[Link 1](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/dataiteam-titanic-eda)
		-[Link 2](https://www.kaggle.com/subinium/awesome-visualization-with-titanic-dataset)
		-[Link 3](https://www.kaggle.com/jkokatjuhha/in-depth-visualisations-simple-methods)
	- Notice what all notebooks check for when examining the data. Did any notebook find something about the data that the other two did not find? Note your favorite visualization - what did it tell you about the data?
	- (Optional) If you haven't explored the Titanic dataset yet, and reading those notebooks gave you ideas for a visualization, load the data up and try it yourself!
* Missing Data
    - Complete the following Kaggle tutorials:
        - [Missing Values](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/handling-missing-values)
		- [Inconsistent Data Entry](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/inconsistent-data-entry)
* Imbalanced Classes
    - Only do section 1 (Introduction and Preparing Your Data) of the DataCamp Fraud Reduction in Python course [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/fraud-detection-in-python)
    
* Dimensionality Reduction
	- Dimensionality reduction can be a tricky concept to wrap your brain around (unless your brain exists in hugely multidimensional space). Read the following but don't stress too much if the concepts aren't 100% clear - pick up what you can and we will try to clear things up in class.
